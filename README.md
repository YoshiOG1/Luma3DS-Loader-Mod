# Modified Loader sysmodule for [Luma3DS](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS)
**WARNING:** This version of the loader sysmodule is experimental, and if used improperly, it may make your system less secure!  In other words, if you're a noob, don't do anything stupid with this; only use it for things like Home Menu text mods, etc. (if you want to play it safe, don't use this)

---

### What is this?
This is a tweaked version of the loader sysmodule used by Luma3DS for Nintendo 3DS family systems.  It basically allows any running process to load game patches, not just games.

**Do *not* use 3DS-SSL-Patch with this unless you know exactly what you're doing!**

### How do I use it?
First, copy the pre-built `loader.cxi` from the Releases page to `/luma/sysmodules/loader.cxi` on your 3DS's SD card.  Then, reboot into Luma3DS config (hold Select on boot), enable **Enable loading external FIRMs and modules**, and press Start to exit.

A guide on how to change text on the Home Menu might be coming soonâ„¢
